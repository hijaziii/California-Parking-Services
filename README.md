# California Parking Services

Our group redesigned California Parking Services 15 years old full-service parking website. 
The company is California Parking Services based in Commerce, California and they needed help
making their website more accessible and modern looking with more interactive features for the user. 

We redesigned 6 pages that represent the services and features of CPS including Valet, Parking Management, Special Events,
Transportation, Contact, Home page, and their new Mobile Car Wash. Each group member had 2 pages assigned to them, but we
ended up editing everyone's and working very collaboratively. On the home page, we created 3 server-side and 3rd party API's
all designed to help plan your next event that would require professional parking services including a local weather app, Google maps, and a Coronavirus API that gives daily, dynamic updates on cases in your area.

For the framework, we used Materialize, and powr.io for the Contact page, so the owners of the company can be in direct
communication with inquiring customers. We also added 5 social media pages- as the company had none- that are all linked
in the footer of each page, they include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn. This social media accessibility
gives customers opportunities to mention us in their posts or upload their own photos and videos of the positive experience they have at a big event.

Each card on the home page is linked to the page it represents along with the tabs in the responsive NavBar to give users
many options to navigate the website. We've included Contact hyperlinks on each page naturally within the text to constantly 
direct the user back to the page that most easily connects the owner and the user.

All photos are updated, responsive and relevant to the service they provide.
